I followed the DIY Skate - How to make a 3' quarter pipe. 

I understood the blueprints and its dimensions in order to sketch the design. 

Ordered coping rail - SCH 80 pipe 2" ID and 2.375 Outside Diamter - for $99.07 including shipping. 
Purchased 7 2x4 lumber at homedepot for $56.49.
Purchased and picked up the one 3/4 and one 3/8 plywood at Hardwoods warehouse for $268.67. Each was 4x8 feet.
Powersaw, nails, screws, other equipment for cutting from a diy store for $112.35. 
Transition material platew on amazon for $30
Bought and applied a polyeurethane sealant for Water damage and UV damage prevention for $60.99
Total Cost = $627.57

Avg cost of quater pipe is $300-$400

While the average cost does not include the cost of sealant from weather, tools like powersaw, tables to cut, I 
have still spent more than what the average quarter pipe will sell for. Even though I am at a net loss I am happy 
with the porject outcome and hope to build a bigger ramp in the future with different geometry, color, and design.
